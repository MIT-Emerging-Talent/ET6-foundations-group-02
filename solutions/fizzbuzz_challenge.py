def fizzbuzz(n):
    """
    Fizzbuz function takes an integer n as input and prints the numbers
    from 1 to n with the rules:
        - if a number is divisible by 3, print 'Fizz' instead of the number;
        - if a number is divisible by 5, print 'Buzz' instead of the number;
        - if a number is divisible by both 3 and 5, print 'FizzBuzz';
        - otherwise, print the number itself.

    Parameters: integer number (n)

    Returns: print numbers from 1 to n based on given rules.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: if the argument is not integer
        AssertionError: if the argument is less than 0

    Example:

    >>>> fizzbuzz (0)
    []

    >>>> fizzbuzz (5)
    1
    2
    Fizz
    4
    Buzz

    >>>> fizzbuzz(15)
