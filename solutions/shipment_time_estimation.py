    Estimate the delivery time based on distance and average speed.

    Parameters:
    distance (float): The distance to the delivery location in kilometers.
    average_speed (float): The average speed of the delivery trucks in kilometers per hour.

    Returns:
    float: The estimated delivery time in hours.

    Preconditions:
    - distance must be a non-negative float or int.
    - average_speed must be a positive float or int.

    Raises:
    AssertionError: If any of the preconditions are violated.

    Examples:
    >>> shipment_time_estimation(100, 50)
    2.0
    >>> shipment_time_estimation(1500, 100)
    15.0
    >>> shipment_time_estimation(0, 10)
    0.0


    AssertionError: average_speed must be greater than zero.
    AssertionError: distance must be non-negative.
