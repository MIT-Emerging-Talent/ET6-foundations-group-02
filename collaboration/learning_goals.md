# Learning Goals

The **Team Code Review Project** is designed to provide a learning environment where team
members can develop and practice core coding and collaboration skills. The goals
below outline the key areas that we will focus on throughout the project.

## 1. Practice Coding Within the Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD)

- **Objective**: Each team member should work within their Zone of Proximal Development (ZPD),
  meaning they should focus on tasks that are just beyond their current abilities but still
  achievable with some guidance.
- **Why**: This approach ensures that everyone is constantly challenged but not overwhelmed.
  It allows for gradual learning and ensures that no one is left behind in their development.
- **How**: Team members will select coding tasks that are slightly more advanced than what
  they can do independently, but with enough support from peers and mentors. These tasks will
  include writing simple Python functions, integrating them into the project, and testing them.

## 2. Master Basic GitHub & VSCode Collaboration

- **Objective**: Team members should be able to use GitHub and VSCode effectively to
  collaborate on coding tasks. This includes understanding how to push code, make pull requests, and review changes using GitHub.
- **Why**: GitHub and VSCode are essential tools for version control and code collaboration in a
  professional development environment. Mastery of these tools is crucial for team-based projects.
- **How**: We will regularly practice pushing code to GitHub, using branches for feature development,
  and opening pull requests for code reviews. We’ll also ensure that everyone is
  familiar with using VSCode as their code editor and debugging tool.

## 3. Develop the Habit of Checking Code Against the Code Review Checklist

- **Objective**: Team members will make it a habit to review their code against a pre-defined
  **Code Review Checklist** before submitting it for review. This checklist will include aspects.
- **Why**: Checking code before submitting it for review will reduce errors, increase the quality of code,
  and help each team member grow as a developer.
- **How**: We will create and maintain a **Code Review Checklist** that must be completed before
  submitting code for review. This will help everyone ensure that they are consistently writing high-quality, maintainable code.

## 4. Learn Basic GitHub Functionalities: Code Review, Project Boards, and Task Management

- **Objective**: Team members will learn to use GitHub not only for version control but also for
  project management tasks like code reviews, using project boards, and tracking tasks.
- **Why**: GitHub provides a range of functionalities to help manage a project effectively,
  from task tracking to collaboration on code reviews. Familiarity with these features will make the
  team more efficient.
- **How**: We will use **GitHub Issues** to track tasks, create **Project Boards** for organizing tasks and
  milestones, and regularly conduct **Code Reviews** using GitHub’s pull request system.

## 5. Provide Constructive Feedback During Code Reviews

- **Objective**: Team members will learn how to provide **constructive feedback** during code reviews. This includes:
  - Offering suggestions for improving code quality
  - Providing positive feedback on good practices
  - Helping peers understand potential issues in their code
- **Why**: Constructive feedback is essential for growth and improvement. As beginners, learning how to
  give and receive feedback is an important skill.
- **How**: During code reviews, we will focus on providing actionable, respectful feedback.
  Each team member will be encouraged to ask clarifying questions if they don't understand the
  feedback.

## 6. Learn Git Basics: Pull, Push, Commit, and Solve Merge Conflicts

- **Objective**: Team members will learn how to use Git for basic operations such as
  **pulling**, **pushing**, and **committing** code. They will also learn how to **resolve merge
conflicts** if they arise.
- **Why**: Git is an essential tool for collaborative coding. Learning how to manage code versions,
  merge changes, and resolve conflicts is crucial for teamwork.
- **How**: We will practice common Git commands during each stage of the project. If conflicts
  arise during merging, we will work together to resolve them and ensure the
  codebase stays stable.

## 7. Understand and Review Other People’s Code

- **Objective**: Team members will not only focus on their own code but also develop the skill
  to **fully understand other people's code**. This includes reading and reviewing pull
  requests and understanding the logic behind someone else’s approach.
- **Why**: Understanding others' code is an important skill in any development environment.
  It helps you become a better collaborator, provides opportunities to learn from others, and
  enhances your ability to debug and improve code.
- **How**: Team members will be encouraged to **review each other's pull requests** thoroughly,
  providing feedback and suggestions. We will also encourage active discussion about different coding approaches to promote learning.

## 8. Create a Safe Environment for Learning

- **Objective**: The team will create a **safe, supportive environment** where everyone feels comfortable
  practicing and making mistakes. This includes being open to asking questions,
  offering help, and learning from failures.
- **Why**: A safe learning environment allows team members to take risks, try new things,
  and learn from their mistakes without fear of judgment. This is especially important for beginners.
- **How**: We will encourage a **growth mindset** and support each other’s learning journey.
  Regular team check-ins will be held to discuss any challenges or concerns.

## 9. Conduct a Proper Retrospective After Code Review Completion

- **Objective**: After completing the code review process, the team will conduct a
  **retrospective** to reflect on the project’s successes and areas for improvement. This will allow us
  to learn from our experiences and improve for the next project.
- **Why**: Retrospectives are a valuable way to identify what worked well, what didn’t,
  and how we can improve in future projects. This helps the team grow and adapt continuously.
- **How**: At the end of the project, we will hold a **retrospective meeting**
  where each team member can share their thoughts on what went well and what could be improved. We will
document action items for the next phase of learning.

### **Conclusion:**

By the end of the **Team Code Review Project**, the team will have learned valuable skills in coding,
collaboration, version control, code review processes, and constructive feedback.
These skills will be foundational for future software development work, and the project will
serve as an opportunity to apply those skills in a real-world context.
