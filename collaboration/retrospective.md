2. **Teamwork and Mutual supportip**  
   - Members actively supported each other, contributing to a positive learning environment.  
   - Troubleshooting challenges as a team became one of our best practices.  

3. **Workflow and Task Management**  
   - The project board provided a high-level view of tasks and responsibilities, helping active members track progress and stay organized.  
   - The group followed the planned workflow and met the overall project deadline despite some internal delays.  

4. **Clean Code Practices**  
   - Team members wrote clean, readable code, aligning with the goals of effective communication through written code.  
   - Code reviews highlighted opportunities for improvement, further enhancing code quality.

## What Could Be Improved

1. **Procrastination**  
   - Some tasks were left until the last moment, creating unnecessary pressure and delays.  
   - Push-related challenges and issues took longer than expected to resolve, impacting group timelines.  

2. **Engagement**  
   - Not all team members were consistently active, resulting in uneven distribution of workload.  
   - More effort is needed to encourage and engage inactive members to contribute to the project.

3. **Unforeseen Challenges**  
   - Issues with the extension update (Ruff) and unexpected technical challenges consumed additional time.  
   - Assumptions about group-wide familiarity with tools like Git and Python slowed down certain workflows.

## Lessons Learned

- **Communication is Key**:  
  Consistent and open communication between team members was critical for overcoming challenges and maintaining morale.  
- **Team Troubleshooting Works**:  
  Collaborating on problem-solving not only sped up issue resolution but also helped everyone learn new skills.  
- **Clean Code Matters**:  
  Writing clear and easy-to-read code significantly improved understanding during reviews and handoffs.  
- **Adaptability Is Crucial**:  
  Challenges like the Ruff extension update reminded us to remain adaptable and willing
  to consult wider community and documentation when needed.

## Actionable Recommendations

### What We Should Stop Doing

- **Procrastination**: Start addressing tasks earlier in the workflow to prevent last-minute bottlenecks.

### What We Should Continue Doing

- **Support and Mentorship**: Maintain a collaborative and supportive environment via Slack.  
- **Open Communication**: Keep the Slack channel active for daily check-ins and updates.  

### What We Should Start Doing

- **Regular Sync-Up Meetings**: Incorporate more frequent team meetings to check progress and align on tasks.  
- **Encourage Engagement**: Actively engage and support less active team members to ensure an equitable distribution of workload.  
- **Work-Life Balance**: Focus on balancing project work with personal commitments to avoid burnout.

## Reflections on Strategy

### What Worked

- The workflow on the project board provided clarity on task progress and ownership.  
- Active members of the team successfully completed tasks
- within the instructor-set timeframe.  

### What Didnâ€™t Work

- Internal deadlines were delayed due to technical challenges and inconsistent participation.  
- Unexpected issues like the Ruff extension update consumed additional time and disrupted the workflow.  

### What Needed to Be Added

- Regular check-ins to monitor progress and adjust strategies in real time.  
- Revisiting recorded lectures and team discussions became an unplanned but necessary part of the workflow.
