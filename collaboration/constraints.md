# Constraints

Some boundaries around our project.

## External

<!--
  constraints coming from the outside that your team has no control over:
  - project deadlines
  - number of unit tests required to pass a code review
  - technologies (sometimes a client will tell you what to use)
  - power or connectivity
  - ...
-->
- **Project Deadline**: The team has a specific deadline to complete the project. This is a
  key external constraint that will guide our pace and priorities.
- **Code Review Requirements**: All code must pass a basic code review. This includes ensuring all
  functions are properly documented, tested, and all the code review checklist items are all ticked.
- **Technologies**: We are using Python 3.x, and  `unittest` library for completing the unit testing .
- **Scope of the Task**: Each team member is solving a simple solution selected from the board or
  picked by him/her-self working on a small-scale project suitable for beginners.
  This means there will be certain limitations on functionality, and the tasks are expected to be simple.

## Internal: Involuntary

<!--
  constraints that come from within your team, and you have no control over:
  - each of your individual skill levels
  - amount of time available to work on the project
-->
- **Individual Skill Levels**: Since most of the team members are beginners, there will be varying levels of
  familiarity with Python and coding in general. This could affect the time spent on coding tasks and collaboration.
- **Time Availability**: Each team member has a limited number of hours per week to dedicate
  to the project, balancing other commitments such as school/work/family. This affects how fast we can make progress.
- **Familiarity with Git**: Some team members may need additional time to get comfortable with
  version control tools like Git and GitHub, which could slow down collaboration initially.

## Internal: Voluntary

<!--
  constraints that your team decided on to help scope the project. they may include:
  - coding style & conventions
  - agree on a code review checklist for the project repository
  - the number of hours you want to spend working
  - only using the colors black and white
-->
- **Coding Style & Conventions**: As a group, we’ve agreed to follow the code style explained during
  the MIT Emerging Talent Course. This includes using clear, descriptive variable names, writing
  functions that are easy to understand, and making it easy for team members to read.
- **Code Review Checklist**: We have agreed to review each other's code based on the checklist provided
  by the course instructor.
- **Working Hours**: We aim to spend at least 5 hours per week on the project,
  but each member’s actual availability may vary. We’ll schedule video calls and check-ins based on availability.
- **Functionality Limitations**: We’ve decided to keep the scope simple by avoiding complex algorithms
  or high-level frameworks, focusing on basic Python skills like writing functions, basic logic, and testing.
